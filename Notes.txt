In redux folder , will create new folders 
Store, inside store we create index.js
inside the file we import {createStore} from "redux"
createStore() tkes 3 arguments
1)the main reducer of your application
2)the initial state for your application
3)an enhancer function, necessary for example the redux devTools
Number 2 , The initial state for the app is going to be an object just like the initial state for individual component
export const initialState = {
	count : 0, 
}

createStore()

In the redux folder we create reducers folder at the same level
Inside reducer we create index.js
Number 1 , the main reducer function, pure js function 
with the same imput , it will always output the same result without any side-effect
a reducer is really like a robot, can do a few things, very precise operations
The purpose of the reducer: take the existing state, the action dispatched and compute the new state of the app 
The reducer will generte the new state of the application
export const mainReducer = (state = initialState, action ) => {
	switch(action.type){
	..the type of an action is a mandatory action it will describe what the action wants and it will be always a string 
	default : ..the default case dosen't change the state
		return state ..default behaviour to not break if an unknown action type is dispatched  
	
}
}
